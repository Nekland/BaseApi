Nekland Base API
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Nekland/BaseApi.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Nekland/BaseApi)

Why
---

I made this project because I created a lib for Youtube API and another for Souncloud API.

Both libs have the same needs. To avoid duplicated code, I made this little project that can be used as a base for the API lib you want to create.

How
---

- [x] [Semver](http://semver.org) compliant
- [x] [HHVM](http://hhvm.com/) compatible
- [x] [Composer](http://packagist) installable

Documentation
-------------

This project does not need so much documentation but I wrote some for interested people. Checkout the [doc](doc) folder.

> This project is inspirated by KNPLabs api libs.
