================

The idea is to made easy build of new PHP api libs. So this lib provide you some abstract class that will work together with other classes.

You will learn more about things in the dedicated pages of doc:

* [Api classes](api_classes.md)
* [Auth and Cache strategies](auth_and_cache.md)
* [Transformers](transformers.md)
