Api classes
===========


They should simply extends the `AbstractApi` class.

She provide you useful methods (get/put/post/delete rest methods) and as the class do some job, you just have to create methods like:

* getResourceById
* deleteResource


> You have to register a namespace to your api objects in the api factory
